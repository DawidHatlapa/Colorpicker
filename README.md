# colorpicker
#Story
You've recently heard that several web designers complained about how hard it is to find a proper background color when they design a website.

"How awesome it would be to have an application where we can try any color in a browser..."

"I hate calculating those weird hashtag numbers web developers always ask for..."

You made up your mind to help them and implement a solution.

#What are you going to learn?
You will learn and practice the following topics:

representing colors in hexadecimal (HEX) and RGB format
calculating between number systems (e.g. from base 10 to base 16)
dynamically setting DOM elements' colors with JavaScript
validating number input fields with built-in html validation
transparent colors


#Tasks
Validate input fields

Input fields should have a minimum and maximum validation because the Red, Green and Blue (R-G-B) values are always in range 0-255.
Input fields do not allow to set a number below 0 / above 255 with the up/down arrows.
When we type a number below 0 / above 255 manually in an input field, it should get a red border to indicate that the value is invalid.
Change body background

Implement a dynamically changeable background for the page.
Input fields have a default value which is the R-G-B value of the page's initial background (#999999)
When we set a new value of an input field, background of the page changes according to the new value.
Calculate HEX value

Calculate and show the actual color's value in hexadecimal format.
There is a javascript function that returns a string for the given R-G-B input in hexadecimal format. (e.g. #123456)
The algorithm should be written by student, copy a whole solution from Stackoverflow is not allowed in this case - it would be too easy, we suggest to use them only to test your solution.
The hexadecimal format of the actual color is written in the prepared area.
Calculate binary values

Calculate and show the actual color's R-G-B values in binary format.
There is a javascript function that returns a string for the given R-G-B input in binary format. (e.g. 10001001)
The algorithm should be written by student, copy a whole solution from Stackoverflow is not allowed in this case - it would be too easy, we suggest to use them only to test your solution.
The binary format of the actual color's R-G-B values are written in the prepared area.
Make transparency settable

Make a new input field next to the existing three, which can set transparency of the background.
There is a new input field and a label named Transparency which can contain values in a specified range (e.g. 0-100 / 0-255, 0-1 - it's your choice).
The new field's default value is the maximum of the specified range. (It means that the background is not transparent at all by default.)
When the new field's value changes, body element's background transparency should change according to the new value. User should change it from full transparent to full visible.
#General requirements
None

#Hints
If you google for it, you can find many RGB-HEX converter functions created by others, but now the goal is to write an own algorithm.
You should change the background of the body element when user sets a new value. If you do so, you can also test the task Make transparency settable by setting e.g. an image as the background-image of the html element. The image will be "under the colored body" and will be visible when transparency is not set to fully visible
In browsers' inspectors there is a built-in color picker which is accessible by clicking on the colored square next to a color when editing an element's CSS.
If you inspect the CSS file in the starter code, you can get some ideas for your other projects as well.
#Background materials
Computer number systems
CSS color reference
 Form validation

Use Bootstrap, if you don't want to spend too much time with design.

For displaying various (error) messages, you can use the flash function of Flask.
Use Javascript
modules
for cleaner codebase.
